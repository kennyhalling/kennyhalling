## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Kenneth Halling, a student at Brigham Young University-Idaho interested in computer science, full-stack development, and databases. Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I'm currently majoring in computer science, with plans to focus some of my courses on databases in particular. As far as career goals go, I'm not 100% sure what field I want to go into. I am sure, however, that computers fascinate me, and I am striving to learn all that I can about them!

So far in my education, I have gathered a number of useful skills under my belt:
  - Intermediate knowledge of Python
  - Intermediate knowledge of C#
  - Basic knowledge of HTML and CSS
  - Basic knowledge of Javascript
  - Basic knowledge of MySQL
  - Self-taught knowledge of using the Jekyll static site generator

Beyond these more technical skills, I've developed some other skills working as a student, manufacturing technician, and a junior cybersecurity researcher:
  - Reasearching skills
  - Writing skills
  - An eye for detail and efficiency

You can check out some of my schoolwork in other repositories, and I'll likely have many more projects posted on here before I graduate in two years. Beyond these however, I'm currently using Jekyll to build myself a website to hone and then showcase my programming skills, and pretty soon I'll be starting a project centered around a hobby of mine: Dungeons and Dragons. I'll keep everyone up to date on that one!
