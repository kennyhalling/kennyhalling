# Learn morea about Code Cells: https://quarto.org/docs/reference/cells/cells-jupyter.html

# Include and execute your code here
from palmerpenguins import load_penguins
df = load_penguins()
```

## QUESTION|TASK 1

__Include the tables created from [PY4DS: CH2 Data Visualization](https://aeturrell.github.io/python4DS/data-visualise.html) used to create the above chart (Hint: copy the code from 2.2.1. The penguins data frame and paste each in the cells below)__


```{python}
# Include and execute your code here

# load penguins data frame
penguins = load_penguins()
penguins

```

_include figures in chunks and discuss your findings in the figure._

```{python}
# Include and execute your code here

#view head of penguins table only
penguins.head()

```


## QUESTION|TASK 2

__Recreate the example charts from [PY4DS: CH2 Data Visualization](https://aeturrell.github.io/python4DS/data-visualise.html) of the textbook. (Hint: copy the chart code from 2.2.3. Creating a Plot, one for each cell below)__


```{python}
# Include and execute your code here

#Create a scatterplot of the penguins table where "x" is flipper length and "y" is body mass. Color code the points to 
#represent what species they are.
(
    ggplot(
        data=penguins,
        mapping=aes(x="flipper_length_mm", y="body_mass_g", color="species"),
    )
    + geom_point()
)

```

_include figures in chunks and discuss your findings in the figure._

```{python}

#Add lines that represent the relationship of a penguin's flipper length to their body mass by species
(
    ggplot(
        data=penguins,
        mapping=aes(x="flipper_length_mm", y="body_mass_g", color="species"),
    )
    + geom_point()
    + geom_smooth(method="lm")
)
```


```{python}
# Include and execute your code here

#Apply the color codes for species ONLY to the points. The result is a single line representing the relationship between 
#flipper length and body mass for ALL penguins in the data frame.
(
    ggplot(data=penguins, mapping=aes(x="flipper_length_mm", y="body_mass_g"))
    + geom_point(mapping=aes(color="species"))
    + geom_smooth(method="lm")
)

```


```{python}
# Include and execute your code here

# Apply a shape to each point based on the species that they represent.
(
    ggplot(data=penguins, mapping=aes(x="flipper_length_mm", y="body_mass_g"))
    + geom_point(mapping=aes(color="species", shape="species"))
    + geom_smooth(method="lm")
)

```


```{python}
# Include and execute your code here

#Add human readable labels to the table, including labels for the x and y axix, a label for the legend, a table title, and #a table subtitle
(
    ggplot(data=penguins, mapping=aes(x="flipper_length_mm", y="body_mass_g"))
    + geom_point(aes(color="species", shape="species"))
    + geom_smooth(method="lm")
    + labs(
        title="Body mass and flipper length",
        subtitle="Dimensions for Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo Penguins",
        x="Flipper length (mm)",
        y="Body mass (g)",
        color="Species",
        shape="Species",
    )
)

```
